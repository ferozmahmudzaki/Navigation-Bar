## Responsive Navigation Menu Bar in HTML CSS
Hey friends, today in this blog you’ll learn how to create a Fully Responsive Navigation Menu Bar using only HTML & CSS. In the earlier blog, I have shared how to create a Responsive Sidebar Menu using HTML & CSS and now it’s time to create a navigation bar in HTML.

As you know the Menu Bar or Navigation Bar (Navbar) is important for any kind of website. Many websites have a responsive navbar or a responsive navbar with a dropdown menu. Essentially, responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width and prevents visitors from mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.

In our design (Responsive Navigation Bar), as you can see in the preview image, there is a horizontal navigation bar or navbar with a logo on the left side and some navigation links on the right side. This is a very simple navigation bar and it is created using only HTML & CSS.

The best part about this navigation bar is, it is fully responsive for any kind of device including mobile phones. On the pc, this navigation bar displayed in a horizontal line but on mobile devices, this navbar or navigation bar displayed in a vertical line. On the mobile, you have the option to show or hide the menu bar by clicking on the hamburger menu icon.
